# jaeger-to-mattermost

jaeger-to-mattermost is an application that retrieves error traces from Jaeger Opentracing every minute and POSTs them to Mattermost webhook.

## How to install

If you are using Docker, run the following commands:


```docker
docker build . -t $NAME
docker run -d -e NAME=$NAME -p 3005:3005 --restart always $NAME
```

If you are using only Node.js, follow these steps in the app directory:

```javascript
npm install
node ./index.js
```

## How to start application

To start the application, you should use the web interface. By default, the app runs on port 3005, but you can change it in ```index.js```.

To start the app, make a GET request to ```http://domain.com:3005/start```, and to stop it, make a GET request to ```http://domain.com:3005/stop```.

## Application Configuration

The default configuration parameters are:

```javascript
const defaults = {
	start: new Date().getTime(), // The time app start to search error traces
	backInverval: 2 * 60000, // The interval between start and end paremeters of jaeger
	requestInterval: 1 * 60000, // The interval app request data from jaeger
	limit: 5 //Prevent spam when there is a lot of errors
}
```
